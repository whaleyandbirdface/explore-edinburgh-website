			     <p><strong>Palace of Holyrood House</strong><br>

  The Queen’s Edinburgh home was built as an Abbey for Augustinian canons and then transformed into a royal palace in the 16th Century. Built in the shadow of Arthur’s Seat and bordered by Holyrood Park the Palace enjoys a unique position almost urban and rural. Holyrood is best known as the home of Mary Queen of Scots. The palace has a romantic and atmospheric feel and it really is worth taking the time to experience this. Today the Royal apartments are used by the Queen for state and ceremonial entertaining. As well as touring the Palace visitors can visit The Queen’s Gallery where magnificent works of art from The Royal Collections can be seen. Holyrood House is open daily except 25th March, 25-26 December and during Royal visits. There is a spacious café with a terraced area for sunny weather.<br>

			       April-October 9.30am-6pm

			     <p><strong>Calton Hill</strong><br>

			       Just like Arthur’s Seat and Castle Rock, Calton Hill is a volcanic outcrop. Sitting at the east end of the New Town Calton Hill offers spectacular panoramic views of the Old and New Towns, Holyrood Palace, Arthur’s Seat and the Firth of Forth. Although the climb up the steep cobbled lane is hard going, on a clear day Calton Hill is the perfect spot to relax and observe the cities hustle and bustle.</p>

			     <p><br>

		            On the south side of the hill is the Nelson Monument erected in 1807 to celebrate Nelson’s victory at Trafalgar. On the centre of the hill the dozen pillars of the National Monument honour the soldiers killed in the Napoleonic Wars. Intended to be a full-scale replica of the Parthenon in Athens construction ceased when funds ran-out, earning it the nickname Edinburgh’s disgrace.</p>

			     <p><br>

		            Calton Hill is also home to the former City Observatory which now houses the Edinburgh Experience- a twenty minute 3-D show on the city’s history.</p>   </div>
