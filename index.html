     <p><strong>Edinburgh</strong> is truly one of the most captivating cities in Europe a must for all visitors either as a weekend break or as part of a tour of Scotland. Edinburgh is a historic, diverse and cosmopolitan city, from National galleries and Museums to fabulous restaurants and nightlife Edinburgh has it all.</span></p><p><strong>Edinburgh’s dramatic skyline</strong> is dominated by Edinburgh Castle home of the Scottish crown jewels and host to the world famous annual military Tattoo. From Edinburgh Castle the Royal mile leads down through the medieval Old Town with its tightly packed tenements and closes to The Palace of Holyrood House and the award winning new Scottish parliament building.</p>			      
		            <p><strong>To the north of Edinburgh Castle</strong> are the city's main shopping streets Princess Street, Rose Street and George Street with a large range of shops restaurants and bars. Beyond lies the elegant Georgian New Town area of the city with its squares and crescents designed by James Craig in the 18th century. These beautiful buildings were created for Edinburgh’s professional classes, with servants quarters located at the end of streets and stable accommodation behind.</p>			      
		            <p><strong>Hidden below the south-facing drop of Edinburgh Castle</strong> is the Grassmarket where long ago the monks of Greyfriars held cattle sales. Nowadays this area has hotels and small speciality shops hidden between the boutiques and restaurants.</p>			      <p class="style1">Lying on the Firth of Forth, <strong>Leith is the port of Edinburgh</strong>. Leith served as Scotland’s main port from the 14th to 19th centuries. Now this historic area is thriving with many seafood restaurants and bistros. The Ocean Terminal Centre opened in 2001 is a modern shopping centre situated next to the Royal Yacht Britannia and its visitor centre.</p>			      <p class="style1">Scotland’s Capital combines its many historic monuments, galleries and museums with a year-round theatre, music and dance programme. <strong>August is Festival month in Edinburgh</strong> with the Edinburgh International Festival and Edinburgh Fringe Festival providing world-class music, drama and comedy. The streets of the city become one huge stage with street performers, processions and stalls. The climax each year comes with the open-air concert by The Scottish Chamber Orchestra in Princess Street Gardens accompanied by a firework display from Edinburgh Castle.</p>			      <p><strong>Edinburgh’s Capital Christmas Festival</strong>, introduced in 2000, brings festive cheer to the Christmas shoppers with a German Christmas Market, street performers and <br>
		            Family entertainments. Over the New Year, Edinburgh becomes the Hogmanay Capital of the World.</p>			      <p><span style="font-size: 16px"><strong>Edinburgh</strong> really does have something for everyone whatever their age, interests or<br>
